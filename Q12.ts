// Q12 - Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let names = ["Afraz", "Javaid", "Haseeb", "Hassan", "Aqib"]
console.log("There was an important saminar going on, I invited " + names[0] + " to come with me")
console.log("There was an important saminar going on, I invited " + names[1] + " to come with me")
console.log("There was an important saminar going on, I invited " + names[2] + " to come with me")
console.log("There was an important saminar going on, I invited " + names[3] + " to come with me")
console.log("There was an important saminar going on, I invited " + names[4] + " to come with me")
